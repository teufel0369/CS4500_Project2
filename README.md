# CS4500_Project2
Task was to build a strange game in JS with 5 day timelines (sprints).

The game is more of a random walk simulation. However, it is a good demonstration on how to build dynamic elements in Javascript.
In addition, there are a lot of great code examples in here on how to construct a grid, etc. in Javascript.
